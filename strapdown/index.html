## Trying to keep up to date...

###### 24/05/2017

Well, it's been a while since I last posted anything on here. I've been so busy printing and getting ready for the next worthing art trail coming up in June (details here, https://worthingartistsopenhouses.com/ I'm at venue 34) that I've just neglected my website. 

The best place to see any up to date prints is over on my Instagram page, @longhurstlino. There you will see progress steps, videos, and final prints. 

I am also working on an Etsy page, so watch this space...

In the mean time, here are some pictures of  recent prints, in various states of progress, enjoy!
