## January 2019 blog

Hello!  Happy new year!

Well, it has been a while!  Wait a sec, that's how I started my last post...oops!  I promise to make this more of a regular thing.

Let's get things back on track.

I'm sure these posts shall evolve over time, to something more constructive, but for now, I just wanted to give a quick update on where I am with things and whats going on in LonghurstLino world...

So, I am currently working on my my prints full time!  Woo-hoo, but also scary! 

What am I doing...?  Well...

- Primarily updating my website, which I've now moved from Wordpress.
Look out for ongoing updates on the main site (longhurstlino.com)

- I am going to be updating my Etsy page.  

- I'm taking part in the 'Meet the Maker' event at Neighbourhood Store in Shoreham!  That's going to be exciting!

- That reminds me, I need to plan what I'm going to be doing for that.....
Come say hi on the 25th January

- There is something else coming up which I am really excited about.  I can't say too much at the moment, but it's going to be great!  Sorry to tease, but I will update as soon as I can.

- Oh, and not forgetting trying to create some new prints!

Well, I wont keep you long.  Thanks for reading. Come back here soon for further insights into the world of longhurstlino!

Cheers!



## Trying to keep up to date...

###### 24/05/2017

Well, it's been a while since I last posted anything on here. I've been so busy printing and getting ready for the next worthing art trail coming up in June (details here, https://worthingartistsopenhouses.com/ I'm at venue 34) that I've just neglected my website. 

The best place to see any up to date prints is over on my Instagram page, @longhurstlino. There you will see progress steps, videos, and final prints. 

I am also working on an Etsy page, so watch this space...

In the mean time, here are some pictures of  recent prints, in various states of progress, enjoy!
